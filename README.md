# A Philosophical Approach to Quantum Fileld Theory by Hans Christian Oettinger
This GitHub repository aims to reproduce the dissipative quantum field theory approach proposed by Hans Christian 
Oettinger

The [book](https://polyphys.mat.ethz.ch/publications/books/a-philosophical-approach-to-quantum-field-theory.html) aims
to combine intuition with robust mathematical image of fundamental particle physics based on the most advanced technique
in quantum field theory guided by four metaphysical postulates. The book demonstrates a dissipative approach for scalar 
field theory and quantum electrodynamics while inventing the usage of Planck scale in quantum gravity which is the topic
of current scientific research. The book tried to relate qft to ontological concepts which later on I will extend it to 
other interesting concept such as art, emotion, poetry, social binding, and religion. Another interesting part discussed
here is a new stochastic simulation technique in qft which is complimentary to the conventional one, i.e. 
**intuition+rigor**.
