# A Philosophical Approach to Quantum Field Theory: Preface
- [Aristotle: All human by nature desire to know](classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.html)
- [New forces have been discovered](10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.042501)
- The knowledge about fundamental particles (deepest aspects of matter) is the most important aspect of scientific  discoveries
- This book combines philosophy (epistemology: theory of knowledge) with qft
- Ludwig Boltzmann & Albert Einstein: a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler and represent phenomena as accurate as possible
- Philosophical ideas about space, time, infinity, and irreversibility are considered

"Successful" (logical clarity+mathematical rigor+natural beauty) physical theories considered here are: 
- [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity)
- [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_theory)
- [gauge invariance = renormalization](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gauge_invariance)

In physics, the image of nature should be tested by confronting with the real world.
As Oettinger mentioned, using perturbation (practical calculations) is a short-coming of this modern approach which can
be handled by symbolic computation. The fruit of this approach is the new stochastic simulation for qft.
