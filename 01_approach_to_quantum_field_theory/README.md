# 1 Approach to Quantum Field Theory

HCO clarifies the relationship b/w "fundamental particle physics" & "quantum field theory".
    The first chapter includes:
         1. a number of philosophical contemplatations
         2. a discussion of mathematical & physical elements

The beauty of the entire approach is a fruit of the intimate relationship b/w QFT and philosophy. The knowledge of linear
algebra and quantum mechanics is required. Note that Khrennikov mentioned since quantum probabilities are based on linear
algebra, they are much simpler for the application of quantum simulation & quantum computation. This is the subject of a 
a more exciting topic in Quantum Measurement Problems, Carbon Capture, Mental Health, Quantum Brownian Motors, and
Quantum Gravity.
Section 1.1: Complex vector spaces, Hilbert space vectors, and density matrices for describing quantum systems, bosons 
and fermions, canonical commutation relations, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures
for the time evolution of quantum systems, and finally a basic idea of the measurement process.
Section 1.2: The basics of quantum mechanics
Section 1.1.3: The crucial construct of Fock spaces (loose way)
Section 1.2.1: Further elaboration of the Fock space (tight way)

## Philosophical Contemplations

This Section includes the following topics:

- The methodology of science is based on the epistemological ideas of Ludwig Boltzmann. 
- The representation of space and time is considered in the light of Immanuel Kant's ideas.
- Infinity and irreversibility are discussed, and some contemporary philosophic considerations about quantum field theory are concluded.
- Note that HCO constantly considered Western philosophy as a source of inspiration for his work. We recommend a hybrid approach where Eastern philosophers such as Mulla Sadra's ideas play a crucial role.
- HCO chooses the conscious approach of Henry Margenau in metaphysical principles (that have an essential role in science). But wait! What are the unconscious methods? How can we apply them in developing a modern QFT?

Margenau believes that a theory should be simple, elegant, and acceptable. 
Simon Altmann distinguishes between metaphysical and meta-physical normative principles. The former are the principles, where the former are beyond the experience, and the latter are directly correlated with experiments (without being derivable from it)
HCO uses the latter spelling, but he means that his metaphysical postulates are grounded in experience.
Furthermore, HCO believes that metaphysical postulates and the evolutions in physics are intertwined, although the former is utilized as a guideline for theory development. Cao initiates this belief. Eonum and HCO agree on this. 


### Images of Nature

This Section talks about Boltzmann's life and methodology in philosophy and physics. His main expertise was in the foundation of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases, which heavily relies on the existence of atoms.
HCO calls theories "Images of Nature" due to the imagination part.

- **On the Development of the Methods of Theoretical Physics in Recent Times**

Albert Einstein's famous quote: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
HCO believes that imagination creates knowledge. Eonum believes that theories are themselves quantum (superposition & entanglement) effects because two different theories can exist and be accurate.
HCO believes in theoretical pluralism, which is different from what Eonum believes. We are more aligned with the ideas of Thomas Kuhn, who stated that "Einstein's theory [of gravity] can be accepted only with the recognition that Newton's was wrong."
Democratizing ideas means there would be crowd competition held by wealthy corporations and choosing the best picture amongst them. While it is based on the law of big numbers, there are more natural ways of approaching a good solution. There has to be yet another way of developing the best theories.
Which is hidden unconsciously (metaphysical treatment postulates). HCO believes that the various mages of nature should compete in a Darwinistic sense, which contradicts how Eonum Inc views approaching the problem. Darwinism is based on competition, and Eonum emphasizes collaboration. The view of being open-minded or the Darwinism approach will result in excluding the losing theories. We aim to include the losing ideas and convert them into winning ones. This takes time, but the community will soon see the impact of inclusion by educating critical thinking, the shapers, and the functional skills of their followers.
Finally, Eonum Inc agrees with Altman's quote: "Naked facts hardly exist at all: they are all processed by us through a network of theoretical constructs."

- **On the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Mechanics**
  * HCO & Boltzmann believe that clarity and consistency of a mathematical image of nature are most important.
  * In the context of QFT, mathematical consistency is crucial.
  * According to Feynman, renormalization group theories are not the way to go with QFT. However, modern renormalization group theory might be the answer.
  * First Metaphysical Postulate: HCO says, "A mathematical image of nature must be rigorously consistent. Mathematical elegance is an integral part of any appealing image of nature."
  * The reliability and truth of theories rely on the "uniformity of nature": the succession of natural events is determined by immutable laws.
  * HCO refers to Dworkin and states that "the intrinsic beauty and sublimity of the universe belong to the characteristic of a religion without a god and continues by saying that with or without (a personalized) god, these properties of the universe should be reflected in the elegance of the mathematical image. Eonum Inc believes that without a God, beauty seizes to exist.
  * HCO's 1st mathematical postulate covers several of the six metaphysical requirements formulated by Margenau:
  * (a) logical fertility ("natural science is joined with logic via mathematics")
  * (b) multiple connections between constructs
  * (c) permanence and stability: where permanence extends over the lifetime of a theory
  * (d) extensibility of constructs: "no special laws for the special physical domain."
  * (e) causality: "constructs shall be chosen as to _generate causal laws_."
  * (f) simplicity & elegance
  * Note that causality is missing from the HCO's 1st metaphysical postulate
  * Bertrand Russel: "The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed not to harm.” If introduced carefully, the principle of causality can still be helpful."
  * HCO incorporates casualty by implicitly assuming that mathematical images for dynamic systems provide autonomous time-evolution equations, thus emphasizing that causality cannot be judged from a partial view of a system. However, he needs to formulate independent time evolution as a metaphysical postulate because critical physical theories, such as equilibrium thermodynamics, may not describe any time evolution.

### Space and Time

- HCO was irritated as a student when cosmologists wrote about several cosmogonic epochs in the first 10^-32 sec of the universe.
- He believes there was no precise measurement at that point, so it is pointless to say precisely what happened.
- He states that if many events happened briefly, shouldn't we introduce a nonlinear function of time, a proper time "felt by the universe" in which cosmological events happen more uniformly?
- Human feels that time passes faster with the increase in age.
- We are used to all appearances happening in space and time. What about the appearance of space and time? How shall we imagine them?
- Similar questions about space & time have been asked by physicists and philosophers even before the Big Bang theory.
- Immanuel Kant:
 - Professor of logic & metaphysics
- His application for this position failed in 1758
- He rejected a chair for the art of poetry: This shows his admirable determination and persistence towards a subject he loves.
- Kant's first philosophical publication at 22, _Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces_ "I have already scribed the path I want to follow. I will line up for this race, and nothing shall stop me from continuing it."
- Money and fame were barriers in Kant's path, and he consistently rejected them.
- Like me, Kant loved living in a small town near water and had a very organized daily routine.
- Kant was a talented speaker with sublime thoughts and a natural sense of humor.
- King Friedrich Wilhelm II ordered Kant not to write about religious subjects.
- Kant's book Critik der reinen Vernunft is one of the most influential milestones in philosophy.
- Kan't _opus magnum_: _Critique of Pure Reason_ or even better: "a critical analysis of the capacity of mere reasoning, that is, independent of all practical experience."
- The first part of Kant's epistemological work is called _Transcendental Aesthetic_ which is dedicated to space & time.
- Eonum Inc needs to distinguish itself from its previous thinkers. Kant competed with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), Isaac Newton (1643-1727), John Locke (1632-1704), Samuel Clarke (1675-1729), George Berkeley (1685-1753), etc.
- Kant's postulate about space & time: space & time should not be imagined as empirical concepts derived from any external experience. (p. 23, p. 30)
- Kant mentions that the perception of space & time instead resides with us. Eonum Inc agrees with time, but the space could be understood through external experiences.
- Kant believes that we have an immediate intuitive view of space and time, an a priori intuition.
- Kant claims that space & time are not properties of things (p. 26), but Eonum Inc believes they are abstracted from gravity. 
- Kant calls his philosophical approach _transcendental idealism_, where idealism states that reality is rooted in mind and that ethereal indicates that we are not dealing with things.
- Kant's space justification: If the perception of space is about something outside us, it would be separated from us in length, and the sought-after representation of space is a prerequisite. (p. 23)
- Time's justification: Without a priori representation of time, we cannot perceive things happening simultaneously or sequentially in time (p. 30).
- A priori & transcendental nature of time: One can remove everything from space until nothing is left (empty space): which is nothing, but one cannot perceive any space (why?)
- Also, one can remove all appearances and events from time but cannot annihilate time itself (p. 31).
- In Kant's time, both space & time were "causally inert"; therefore, they are considered imperceptive or inaccessible to direct experience (experiment).
- Space & time are both singular (in the sense of one-of-a-kind (p. 25)) and infinite in a sense that Kant analyses in some detail.
- A critical property of space & time is their infinity.
- Kant believes that the a priori nature of space depends on the certainty of geometry (Euclidean geometry, p. 24, p. 732)
- Euclidean geometry inherits the a priori one-of-a-kind status of space and hence is a prototypical example for theorems of apodictic certainty.
- Kant treats space & time in a parallel fashion (p. 41) because they are both needed to describe motion, and nothing is like them.
- Large Hydron Collider (LHC): energy measurements by calorimeters and tracks are in a magnetic field.
- ![img.png](img.png)
- Auyang (cf. p. 170 of [24]): _"The primitive spatiotemporal structure is permanent; it is independent of temporal concepts._
- Kant's philosophical ideas about space & time are obsolete because they contradict Einstein's theory of gravity or general relativity.
- HCO believes that the situation could be more precise in the broader sense. "_Even in the presence of gravity, an a priori space-time could exist in a topological sense; gravity as a physical theory would then merely introduce geometric structure into this a priori topological space-time. Only the measurability of space and time would no longer be a priori._"
- Max von Laue [27]
- Alternatively, HCO assigns a priori character to the Minkowski space-time of special relativity. Gravity is introduced as a gauge theory expressing the physical irrelevance of the particular choice of local coordinate systems in Minkowski space. Cf. Lasenby, Doran, and Gull [28].
- The group of inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations, including translations, is an irreducible representation group as classified by Wigner [29], which is a correction to Dirac and Majorana.
- Wigner's representation theory: particles can be classified according to mass and spin, assigning a special role to these properties. (m > 0, s > 0, s = 0, 1, 1/2, etc)
- In HCO's methodology, spin and masses are the fundamental particles.
- HCO loves to assume an underlying Minkowski space with basic measures of length and time.
- These measures will always be distorted due to the massive observers that unavoidably perturb the geometry around them according to Einstein's theory of gravitation (general relativity).
- However, the underlying space tells us by what properties we should label our fundamental particles.
- Auyang (p. 135 of [24]): "the concepts of space and time that are required for the plurality and distinction of objects do not imply any specific geometric property such as those in Euclidean geometry. The approach agrees with Kant that space is not a substance but the precondition for particulars and individuals. It disagrees with Kant that space is a form of intuition."
- Margenau: "more abstract than many other scientific constructs since they possess no immediate counterparts in direct perception" (p. 165 of [7]). 
- Margenau: "Kant’s dichotomy of the a priori and the a posteriori has lost its basis in actual science,” but “if Kant’s conclusion were replaced by a milder one, stating that conceptual space is not compounded from immediate experiences, it would be wholly acceptable” (see p. 148 of [7])."
- HCO formulated his 2nd postulate encouraged by Kant but taking into account the caveats resulting from relativity:
- 2nd metaphysical postulate: Physical phenomena can be represented by theories in space & time; they do not require approaches of space & time, so space & time possess the status of prerequisites for physical ideas.
- HCO: "In the absence of gravity, we can choose a particular reference frame to recover Cartesian space and a well-defined time parameter, just as it is usually done for Maxwell’s equations governing electromagnetic fields. We consider space and time as preconditions for physical theories but leave it open whether they are particularly fundamental constructs ultimately based on experience or a priori intuitions independent of all experience. To maintain the above metaphysical postulate even when general relativity enters the scene, also gravity should be considered as a theory in space and time, introducing a physically relevant geometry into a topological or Minkowski space."
- “Even the most ambitious attempts to come to grips with quantum gravity – as in M-theory, for example – seem to presuppose some sort of pre-existing spacetime background in which the elementary entities of the theory (be they strings, membranes, or what have you) move and interact (see p. 570 of [30])."
- "These additional spaces on the same footing as Kant’s space and time? Do we have an a priori representation of these spaces, or do they rather possess the status of constructs? Are certain interactions providing geometric structure to these additional spaces? The gauge theories for weak and strong interactions introduce geometry into the weak isospin and color spaces. The geometric interpretation of the gauge theories for all fundamental interactions has been elaborated in section 11.3 of [22]."
- "In the context of quantum field theory, a serious problem arises from Kant’s assertion that space and time are infinite. Infinity is an inherent philosophical problem, which we must address in the subsequent section to reveal the distinction between actual and potential infinity and the resulting fundamental importance assigned to limiting procedures."

### Infinity

- Euclid: "The (set of all) prime numbers is more numerous than any assigned multitude of prime numbers."
- Euclid avoids the term infinity: cf. https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/books/Euclid/Euclid.html
- Aristotle has tried to distinguish between actual (permanent infinity), and potential infinity (coming to be like time).
- Only the "potential infinity" was conceived to be meaningful.
- Euclid: potential infinity is a never-ending process in time.
- Bernard Bolzano (1851), Richard Dedekind (1888), and George Cantor (1891) established the foundation of actual infinity, including the classical different levels of infinity.
- HCO: "In field theories, one or several degrees of freedom is associated with each point of space." (infinite according to Kant)
- HCO: "The collection of all degrees of freedom has the cardinality of the continuum."
- Can we handle such a large drgree of freedom? (from mathematical & philosophical points of view). We need to focus on smaller cardinality of the set of natural numbers."
- HCO: "The number of degrees of freedom should, at most, be countably infinite, that is, of the cardinality of the integers rather than the cardinality of the continuum.
- Probability theory: infinities are countable according to Kolmogorov (1933).
- HCO: "In measure theory, the measurement of a countably infinite number of disjoint measurable subsets can be added up to the measure of the full set obtained as the countable union of the subsets, but not for an uncountable union of subsets."
- The concept of separability treats stochastic processes with continuous time evolution by assuming limited numbers for the degree of freedom.
- The concept of separability is introduced by von Neumann for limiting the dimensionality of the arena for quantum mechanics, called Hilbert space, where the number of basis vectors have to be countably infinite or limited to finite.
- In HCO's development of QFT, the number of degrees of freedom remains countable at any stage by using Fock spaces, which are based on occupation numbers for the possible quantum states of a single particle, as the basic arena.
- Concerns regarding infinities of various kinds are addressed through the philosophical horror infinitatis.
- Kant's space is very concerning (horror infinitatis). 
- In QFT development, HCO considers large finite volumes together with a limiting procedure.
- Mathematical image: position space to its dual Fourier space. The finite volume of position space pertains to the discreteness and therefore countability of Fourier space.
- HCO imposes the finite size of Fourier space, that coresponds to eliminating small-scale features in position space, and introduce an associated limiting procedure. This will result in the appearance of irreversibility.
- QFT
	* The number of degrees of freedom: infinitely numerous.
	* The volume of space: infinitely large
	* Position spacwe & associated Fourier space: the dual aspect of infinitely divisible. 
	* Infinitely small: the size of fundamental particles
   * Infinitely large: vales of the divergent integrals: the assumption of point particles in QFT: According to the first metaphysical postulate, any artificial or subtle treatment of divergencies should be prevengted. ("handling of infinities" is a key issue in QFT)
- Third Metaphysical Postulate:
	* All infinities are to be treated as potential infinities; the corresponding limitlessness is to be represented by mathematical limiting procedures; all numerous infinities are to be restricted to countable.
   * HCO introduced 4 different types of limiting procedures:
		1. Thermodynamic limit: A finite # of momentum states of a quantum particle is considered. The thermodynamic limit of an infinite nymber of degrees of freedom needs to be analyzed in such a way that critical behavior & symmetry breaking can be acknowledged.
		2. Limit of infinite volume: HCO considers a finite volume. This assumption offers a large characteristic length scale & infrared regularization, while making the problem of boundary conditions more acute. In the limit of infinite volume, sums are replaced by integrals.
		3. Limit of vanishing dissipation: HCO introduced a dissipative smoothing mechanism which offers ultraviolet regularization, even in the thermodynamic limit. Hence, the corresponding friction parameter is related to a small characteristic length scale & needs to approach to zero.
		4. Zero-temperature limit: HCO considered the dissipative evolution equation at finite temperature, so that rigorous statements about a long-term approach to equilibrium can be made, i.e., in the limit of zero temperature.
- In field theories, a continuum of degrees of freedom, derivtives in the evolution equations for the fields and integrals in their solutions is expected.
- These expectations (idealizations) will be fulfilled via the final limiting procedures.
- Differentiations & integrations are defined in terms of limiting procedures and all limits are postponed (to avoid singularities & paradoxes and to conford with the 3rd metaphysical postulate) to the end of calculation (sums are more difficult to evaluate than integrals).
- An infinite # of momentum states is considered as a hallmark of field theories.
- Computer simulation for analyzing critical behavior in statistical mechanics implements extrapolation from to infinite system successfully.
- It is supported by finite-size scaling theory based on renormalization group methodologies.
- Nature works with large but finite # of degrees of freedome (O(10^23)). Hence, in statistical mechanics, the thermodynamic limit is an idealization.
- Note that the field idealization is a bold idealization, as it presumes that properties can vary from point to point in space & time even on infinitesimally small scales (Planck). 
- Field theoretic approach to hydrodynamics: limits: micrometers (gases), nanometers (liquids). QFT: Planck length (10^-35 m): 3 fundamental physical constants: 1. the speed of light, 2. Planck constant, 3. the gravitational constant
- HCO questions for the QFT community:
	* Why the theory of fundamental particles formulated in an infinitely large volume if the entire universe has a finite volume and a finite age?
	* Why do they insist on a theory of electroweak & strong interactions down to infinitely small scales if they expect that there is a lower limit at the Planck length?
	* Insisting on such actual infinities leads to self-imposed mathematical difficulties.
	* Achieving exact symmetries is questionable due to the approximate nature of symmetries.
	* HCO relies on the limiting procedures associated with potential infinities to preclude all self-imposed problems and focus on the exciting physical challenges of quantum theory in general and QFT in particular.

### Irreversibility

- The empty state introduced by Kant is known as the vacuum state nowadays.
- In QFT, electron-positron pairs & other particle-antiparticle pairs can spontaneously appear for a short time & then disappear (e.g., together with a photon via electromagnetic interactions).
- Auyang: "The vacuum is bubbling with quantum energy fluctuation & doesn't answer to the notion of empty space (of Kant). ..."
- The "where" & "when" of annihilation of the electron-positron pair in unknown but the faster it takes place, the larger is the # of events due to a larger range of energies of the electron & the positron according to Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.
- In quantum mechanics, time is not treated as an operator. As a result, the interpretation of Heisenberg's time-energy uncertainty relation is complex. A comprehensive explanation and derivation can be found in [38], which suggests that the uncertainty in a quantum system's energy is linked to a corresponding uncertainty in the environment's energy.
- The rapid and frequent occurrences of events on a minuscule length and time scale are evidently uncontrollable by any experimenter.
- It is crucial to acknowledge that the absence of mechanistic control over vacuum fluctuations is a natural cause of irreversible behavior.
- Nonequilibrium thermodynamics [39] views unmanageable rapid processes as fluctuations, which inevitably lead to dissipation, irreversibility, and decoherence.
- As it is impossible to govern processes on extremely minuscule length and time scales, irreversibility must be recognized as an inherent characteristic of QFTs (quantum field theories).
- 4th Metaphysical Postulate:
	* In QFT, irreversible contributions to the fundamental evolution equations arise naturally & unavoidably.
- The fourth metaphysical postulate results in a significant deviation from conventional methods of QFT.
- HCO approach abandons the notion that a fundamental theory of particles and interactions must be in Hamiltonian form or reversible.
- HCO now operates with a quantum master equation for a density matrix instead of the Schroedinger equation for a Hilbert space vector.

#### Autonomous Time Evolution

- The HCO approach aims to portray the dynamic behavior of a system of interest using a time-evolution equation.
- To be more specific, his goal is to determine a set of variables that permit the formulation of a closed set of evolution equations without requiring external functions of time.
- Equations or systems of equations that meet this criterion are referred to as autonomous.
- Autonomous equations encapsulate the predictive capabilities of a theory.
- The fundamental task in creating a mathematical representation of nature is to search for appropriate variables and autonomous evolution equations.
