# 1 Approach to Quantum Field Theory

HCO clarifies the relationship b/w "fundamental particle physics" & "quantum field theory".
    The first chapter includes:
         1. a number of philosophical contemplatations
         2. a discussion of mathematical & physical elements

The beauty of the entire approach is a fruit of the intimate relationship b/w QFT and philosophy. The knowledge of linear
algebra and quantum mechanics is required. Note that Khrennikov mentioned since quantum probabilities are based on linear
algebra, they are much simpler for the application of quantum simulation & quantum computation. This is a subject of a 
more interesting topic in Quantum Measurement Problem, Carbon Capture, Mental Health, Quantum Brownian Motors, and
Quantum Gravity.
Section 1.1: Complex vector spaces, Hilbert space vectors, and density matrices for describing quantum systems, bosons 
and fermions, canonical commutation relations, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg pictures
for the time evolution of quantum systems, and finally a basic idea of the measurement process.
Section 1.2: The basics of quantum mechanics
Section 1.1.3: The crucial construct of Fock spaces (loose way)
Section 1.2.1: Further elaboration of the Fock space (tight way)

## Philosophical Contemplations

This Section includes the following topics:

- The methodology of science is based on the epistemological ideas of Ludwig Boltzmann. 
- The representation of space and time is considered in the light of Immanuel Kant's ideas.
- Infinity and irreversibility are discussed, and some contemporary philosophic considerations about quantum field theory are concluded.
- Note that HCO constantly considered Western philosophy as a source of inspiration for his work. We recommend a hybrid approach where Eastern philosophers such as Mulla Sadra's ideas play a crucial role.
- HCO chooses the conscious approach of Henry Margenau in metaphysical principles (that have an essential role in science). But wait! What are the unconscious methods? How can we apply them in developing a modern QFT?

Margenau believes that a theory should be simple, elegant, and acceptable. 
Simon Altmann distinguishes between metaphysical and meta-physical normative principles. The former are the principles, where the former are berond experience and the latter are directly correlated with experiments (without being derivable from it)
HCO uses the latter spelling but he means that his metaphysical postulates are grounded in experience.
Furthermore, HCO believes that both metaphysical poatulates and the evolutions in physics are intertwined, although the former is utilized as a guideline for theory development. This belief is iinitiated from Cao. Eonum and HCO agree on this.
