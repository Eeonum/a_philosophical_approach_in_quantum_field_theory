# 1 Approach to Quantum Field Theory

HCO clarifies the relationship b/w "fundamental particle physics" & "quantum field theory".
    The first chapter includes:
         1. a number of philosophical contemplatations
         2. a discussion of mathematical & physical elements

The beauty of the entire approach is a fruit of the intimate relationship b/w QFT and philosophy. The knowledge of linear
algebra and quantum mechanics is required. Note that Khrennikov mentioned since quantum probabilities are based on linear
algebra, they are much simpler for the application of quantum simulation & quantum computation. This is a subject of a 
more interesting topic in Quantum Measurement Problem, Carbon Capture, Mental Health, Quantum Brownian Motors, and
Quantum Gravity.
Section 1.1: Complex vector spaces, Hilbert space vectors, and density matrices for describing quantum systems, bosons 
and fermions, canonical commutation relations, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures
for the time evolution of quantum systems, and finally a basic idea of the measurement process.
Section 1.2: The basics of quantum mechanics
Section 1.1.3: The crucial construct of Fock spaces (loose way)
Section 1.2.1: Further elaboration of the Fock space (tight way)

## Philosophical Contemplations

This Section includes the following topics:

- The methodology of science is based on the epistemological ideas of Ludwig Boltzmann. 
- The representation of space and time is considered in the light of Immanuel Kant's ideas.
- Infinity and irreversibility are discussed, and some contemporary philosophic considerations about quantum field theory are concluded.
- Note that HCO constantly considered Western philosophy as a source of inspiration for his work. We recommend a hybrid approach where Eastern philosophers such as Mulla Sadra's ideas play a crucial role.
- HCO chooses the conscious approach of Henry Margenau in metaphysical principles (that have an essential role in science). But wait! What are the unconscious methods? How can we apply them in developing a modern QFT?

Margenau believes that a theory should be simple, elegant, and acceptable. 
Simon Altmann distinguishes between metaphysical and meta-physical normative principles. The former are the principles, where the former are beyond the experience, and the latter are directly correlated with experiments (without being derivable from it)
HCO uses the latter spelling, but he means that his metaphysical postulates are grounded in experience.
Furthermore, HCO believes that metaphysical postulates and the evolutions in physics are intertwined, although the former is utilized as a guideline for theory development. Cao initiates this belief. Eonum and HCO agree on this. 


### Images of Nature

This Section talks about Boltzmann's life and methodology in philosophy and physics. His main expertise was in the foundation of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases, which heavily relies on the existence of atoms.
HCO calls theories "Images of Nature" due to the imagination part.

- **On the Development of the Methods of Theoretical Physics in Recent Times**

Albert Einstein's famous quote: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."
HCO believes that imagination creates knowledge. Eonum believes that theories are themselves quantum (superposition & entanglement) effects because two different theories can exist and be accurate.
HCO believes in theoretical pluralism, which is different from what Eonum believes. We are more aligned with the ideas of Thomas Kuhn, who stated that "Einstein's theory [of gravity] can be accepted only with the recognition that Newton's was wrong."
Democratizing ideas means there would be crowd competition held by wealthy corporations and choosing the best picture amongst them. While it is based on the law of big numbers, there are more natural ways of approaching a good solution. There has to be yet another way of developing the best theories.
Which is hidden unconsciously (metaphysical treatment postulates). HCO believes that the various mages of nature should compete in a Darwinistic sense, which contradicts how Eonum Inc views approaching the problem. Darwinism is based on competition, and Eonum emphasizes collaboration. The view of being open-minded or the Darwinism approach will result in excluding the losing theories. We aim to include the losing ideas and convert them into winning ones. This takes time, but the community will soon see the impact of inclusion by educating critical thinking, the shapers, and the functional skills of their followers.
Finally, Eonum Inc agrees with Altman's quote: "Naked facts hardly exist at all: they are all processed by us through a network of theoretical constructs."

- **On the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Mechanics**
  * HCO & Boltzmann believe that clarity and consistency of a mathematical image of nature are most important.
  * In the context of QFT, mathematical consistency is crucial.
  * According to Feynman, renormalization group theories are not the way to go with QFT. However, modern renormalization group theory might be the answer.
  * First Metaphysical Postulate: HCO says, "A mathematical image of nature must be rigorously consistent. Mathematical elegance is an integral part of any appealing image of nature."
  * The reliability and truth of theories rely on the "uniformity of nature": the succession of natural events is determined by immutable laws.
  * HCO refers to Dworkin and states that "the intrinsic beauty and sublimity of the universe belong to the characteristic of a religion without a god and continues by saying that with or without (a personalized) god, these properties of the universe should be reflected in the elegance of the mathematical image. Eonum Inc believes that without a God, beauty seizes to exist.
  * HCO's 1st mathematical postulate covers several of the six metaphysical requirements formulated by Margenau:
  * (a) logical fertility ("natural science is joined with logic via mathematics")
  * (b) multiple connections between constructs
  * (c) permanence and stability: where permanence extends over the lifetime of a theory
  * (d) extensibility of constructs: "no special laws for the special physical domain."
  * (e) causality: "constructs shall be chosen as to _generate causal laws_."
  * (f) simplicity & elegance
  * Note that causality is missing from the HCO's 1st metaphysical postulate
  * Bertrand Russel: "The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed not to harm.” If introduced carefully, the principle of causality can still be helpful."
  * HCO incorporates casualty by implicitly assuming that mathematical images for dynamic systems provide autonomous time-evolution equations, thus emphasizing that causality cannot be judged from a partial view of a system. However, he needs to formulate independent time evolution as a metaphysical postulate because critical physical theories, such as equilibrium thermodynamics, may not describe any time evolution.
