# 1 Approach to Quantum Field Theory

HCO clarifies the relationship b/w "fundamental particle physics" & "quantum field theory".
    The first chapter includes:
         1. a number of philosophical contemplatations
         2. a discussion of mathematical & physical elements

The beauty of the entire approach is a fruit of the intimate relationship b/w QFT and philosophy. The knowledge of linear
algebra and quantum mechanics is required. Note that Khrennikov mentioned since quantum probabilities are based on linear
algebra, they are much simpler for the application of quantum simulation & quantum computation. This is a subject of a 
more interesting topic in Quantum Measurement Problem, Carbon Capture, Mental Health, Quantum Brownian Motors, and
Quantum Gravity.
Section 1.1: Complex vector spaces, Hilbert space vectors, and density matrices for describing quantum systems, bosons 
and fermions, canonical commutation relations, Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg pictures
for the time evolution of quantum systems, and finally a basic idea of the measurement process.
Section 1.2: The basics of quantum mechanics
Section 1.1.3: The crucial construct of Fock spaces (loose way)
Section 1.2.1: Further elaboration of the Fock space (tight way)
